Code Review

The application was able to run successully after cloning it onto my desktop. The app includes all of the needed filters and buttons. The application ran flawlessly and had no glitches. There is some room for improvement visually as it's all one basic color with a bunch of buttons but it works and honestly that's pretty important. 
The code looked good and clean without too many rendunancies in the code. Lots of comments which was helpful for me to navigate. Overall a very good job. The only thing I would say that could be improved upon would be increasing the size of the report in the middle so it's not as condensed when the app is running and also adding some color. Great Job!
