Overall very well done program! comments are clear and informative, code is efficient and clean, form is straightforward and to the point no extra fluff.
I did notice there was a left/right arrow at the top of the form cycling from 1-23, and each subsequent one just went down tothe next selection on the list? not sure what thats
about, it may have even been on mine and i didnt even notice it until now. all buttons function as intended, i see nothing i could really improve upon, form/function works as it should, good job!
