Katherine’s Form design of the database has 9 buttons of:
•	Show Details
•	Population Ascending 
•	Population Descending 
•	Sort by City Name
•	Highest Population
•	Lowest Population
•	Average Population
•	Total Population
•	Exit
The text of the lab should be “Population database” instead of “City Database”. The file name submission was partially met titling, 
“Katherine-Vykhovanets-CPT-206-Lab-2”; which I greatly appreciate the separation title assignments. However, it should have been titled, 
“KVykhovanets-Lab-2” like the course addendum showed at the very last page when submitting the assignment [highlighted in yellow].

The code, inside the Form Design, is neat and clear. There is each comment for each buttons does and left a special comment on Line 60 of a button name change; 
letting me know that it might or might not work. There is another form that connects to the database and the main form [Form Design] which is titled, 
“CityDetails” that shows their ID, City, State, and Population with a “Exit” button. However, there is no comment within the “CityDetails” code that 
it closes the form “CityDetails”.

Upon running the program every single button work fantastically, I especially like the “Sort by City Name” button because I couldn’t figure out how to do it 
properly and see the names in alphabetical order. The overall of this assignment has blown off the scale of greatness if it ended with 10. 
Comparing her program to mine, I need to practice and learn how to do that without deleting and/or adding databases accidentally and need to add a “Exit” button 
in code when connecting to my database and Details form. It also show that I need to take my time when doing the assignment and look for or ask the tutor 
to help me find a way to implement a sort option in alphabetical order by cities names and make sure that I don’t skip anything from the require check list.
