Code Review – Katherine Vykhovanets (By Michael Lee)

I thought your code was well-written and easy to understand, with great use of comments. Only problem I saw was that there seems to be an issue with adding and saving new data to the table (when using the BindingNavigator). There was a minor error one time when trying to select a record as well – not sure why. Overall, we took a lot of similar approaches. Great job on it!
